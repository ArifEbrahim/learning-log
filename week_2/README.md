# Week 2

## Goals:

1. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
2. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
3. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
4. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback 

## Work done / evidence

#### Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
- Attended domain modelling workshop
- Completed workshop exercise (Notebook) [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/learning-log/blob/main/week_2/code/notebook.rb)
- Attended workshop on delegation, class interaction & dependency injection 
- Completed workshop exercise (Company savings) [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/learning-log/blob/main/week_2/code/company_savings.rb)
- Practiced this during the weekly coding challenge (Oystercard) [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/oyster_card3)
- Further practice during the individual weekend coding challenge (Takeaway) [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/takeaway-challenge)

#### Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
- Completed mocking practical [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/learning-log/tree/main/week_2/code/student-mocking-workshop)
- Completed dependancy injection practical [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/learning-log/tree/main/week_2/code/dependency_injection)
- Spoke to a coach to test my understanding of test isolation & tight coupling 
- Also spoke to a coach about how to select the right test when multiple options exist

#### Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
- Made own notes on delegation 

#### Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback 
- Attended code review workshop
- Reviewed Airport challege code of peer and gave feedback
- Read guide on expectations of a good developer 
- Read guide on giving effective feedback
- Attend process workshop and paired with a more experienced developer 
- Gave feedback to pairing partner in process workshop

## Reflections

1. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage (score: 4/5)
  - Worked on three exercises that helped reinfornce this, the seperation of concerns principle and SRP
  - Learned about UML and two new modelling tools to help plan/design code structure before diving in

2. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking (score: 4/5)
  - Made significant progress in my understanding of unit testing & proper test isloation
  - Understaood how to identify tight coupling, the issues is creates and how to solve it
  - I learned how to mock both classes and objects to ensure test isloation

3. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change) (score: 2/5)
  - Did not have much time to cover this objective 

4. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback (score: 3/5)
  - I looked into what a good developr process looks like and how to give feedback
  - I had two opportunites to give feedback on other peoples code
  - I look forward to growing as a developer and being able to give more feedback in future
