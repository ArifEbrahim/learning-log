- Completed birthday greeter practical [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/birthday_greeter)
- Completed counter practical [here]
- Practiced this during the weekly coding challenge (Battle) [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/battle_final)
- Further practice during the individual weekend coding challenge (Rock, Paper, Scissors) [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/rps-challenge)

#### Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
- Attended debugging webapps workshop
- Completed workshop exercise [here]
- Gained practice through the weekly and weekend coding challenges

#### Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
- Attended modelling HTTP request/response workshop
- Completed servers practical [here]

#### Explain the MVC pattern
- Researched MVC
- Made own notes on MVC

## Reflections

1. Build a simple web app (score: 5/5)
  - I gained lots of experience in bulding web apps this week (Birthday Greeter, Battle & RPS)
  - Developed working knowledge of Sinatra & Capybara
  - Learned how to apply TDD to webapps (feature test -> unit test, red/green/refactor)

2. Follow an effective debugging process for web applications (score: 4/5)
  - Lots of practice debugging web apps during the 3 challenges above
  - Good learning from debugging workshop and how to apply a logical process
  - Learned about Chrome Dev tools

3. Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS) (score: 3/5)
  - Good overview in workshop on the different parts of a request/response cycle
  - Basic exposure to HTML this week, would be useful to look into this more

4. Explain the MVC pattern (score: 3/5)
  - Basic understanding of MVC pattern 
  - Read articles on different setups e.g. fat vs skinny controller
