# Week 5

## Goals:

1. Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
2. Build to a specificiation (rather than challenges)
3. Run stand-ups and retrospectives
4. Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
5. Give and receive meaningful code review

## Work done / evidence

#### Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
- Completed first group project involving the creation of an AirBnB clone [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/makers_bnb)
- Worked as part of a team to create tickets and allocate to different team members

#### Build to a specificiation (rather than challenges)
- Converted program requirements into user stories on which to base the code

#### Run stand-ups and retrospectives
- I ran the standup and retro for our team on Wednesday 26th May 
- I ran the planning session for our team where we aligned on project vision, created wireframes and agreed ways of working

#### Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
- As a team we extensively used git features to manage team worflow including rebasing code

#### Give and receive meaningful code review
- Initiated PR's for my code and reviewed PR's for team members before merging 
- Attended second process workshop and paired with a more senior developer
- We reviewed each others developer process / code and gave feedback

## Reflections

This week was a good experience and learning opportunity in a number of areas including:
- working in a team to develop a functioning applications
- breaking down features into smaller tickets and allocating work within a team
- working in an agile environment and leading stand ups / retros
- learning to use git effectively to ensure code remains bug free
- developing ways of working to improve our effectiveness as a team

I also completed the weekend challenge which provided further practice in Ruby 
- Bowling challenge in Ruby [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/bowling-challenge-ruby)
