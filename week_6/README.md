# Week 6

## Goals:

1. Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript
2. Follow an effective process for learning a new language

## Work done / evidence

#### Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript
- Practiced this during the weekly coding challenge Thermostat [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/thermostat)
- Further practice in the weekend coding challenge Bowling Scorecard [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/bowling_challenge_JS)

#### Follow an effective process for learning a new language
- Attended JS debugging workshop & completed workshop exercise
- Attended JS callbacks workshop
- Completed a short JS crash course to understand the syntax
- Completed some simple katas on codewars in JS
- Translated a previous exercise (Airport challenge) in Javascript [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/airport_JS)
- Read materials on arrow functions, callbacks, ajax, event loop, promises & closures 

## Reflections

1. Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript (score: 4/5)
  - successfully completed the weekly challenge (Thermostat)
  - completed the weekend challenge (Bowling challenge in JS)
  - these apps really helped me to understand how to implement the MVC model in JS, HTML & CSS
  - used an API for the first time in JS which also helped my understanding of callbacks and promises

2. Follow an effective process for learning a new language (score: 4/5)
  - This was a challenging week given Javascript is very different to Ruby 
  - I attended workshops to enhace my understanding of debugging & callbacks
  - I researched topics I found more difficult such as closures & promises 
  - I spoke to a coach about a more complicated JS app and how it was built
