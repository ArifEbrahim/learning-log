# Week 4

## Goals:

1. Build a simple web app with a database
2. Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
3. Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships between tables)

## Work done / evidence

#### Build a simple web app with a database
- Completed SQL zoo practical [here](https://sqlzoo.net/)
- Completed diary practical [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/daily_diary)
- Practiced this during the weekly coding challenge (Bookmark manager) [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/bookmark)
- Further practice during the individual weekend coding challenge (Chitter) [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/chitter-challenge)

#### Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
- Gained lots of practice through the weekly and weekend coding challenges

#### Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships between tables)
- Attended domain modelling & CRC workshop
- Completed workshop exercise (Student list)
- Learned about CRC cards, ORM, one-one / one-many relationships

## Reflections

1. Build a simple web app with a database (score: 4/5)
  - I successfully built 3 database connected web-apps this week
  - Continued to follow a strict TDD process (feature test -> unit test, red/green/refactor)

2. Follow an effective debugging process for database applications (score: 3/5)
  - Continued to use stack trace and p statements to locate errors in code

3. Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships between tables) (score: 3/5)
  - This was a very tough week with lots of new concepts and new material to cover
  - I will definately spend some time reviewing materials so strengthen my understanding
