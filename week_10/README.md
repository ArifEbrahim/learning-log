# Week 10

## Goals:

1. Solve a challenging technical problem by writing well crafted code.
2. Feel more confident in your ability to complete a tech test.
3. Have developed a structured process to approaching complex problems, utilising TDD and good OO design skills

## Work done / evidence

#### Solve a challenging technical problem by writing well crafted code.
- Completed the bank tech test [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/bank_tech_test) that simulates simple banking functionality
- Increased the difficulty level significantly by opting to use JS, Jest & ESlint
- Spent a good amount of time planning to understand the problem and develop my approach
- Wrote high quality code with high test coverage and all classes fully mocked

#### Feel more confident in your ability to complete a tech test.
- Received very positive feedback from a coach on the quality of my code 

#### Have developed a structured process to approaching complex problems, utilising TDD and good OO design skills
- I participated in a process workshop to improve my coding process. I also gave feedback to a junior developer to improve their process.
- I solved small & simple problems to further practice TDD and the skill of breaking down problems / writing good tests
- I completed another professional review where I had a professional software developer assess my process to solving a given problem and provide feedback

## Reflections

This week was focussed on code quality and improving my craft which i definately achieved.
- My personal goal was to improve my proficiency with JS which i achieved by doing all my coding this week in JS
- This took me outside my comfort zone but really helped to develop my skill
- In my personal time i built a blog app using Node, Express and MongoDB to start understanding the MERN stack (saving React for later)
- I really focussed on code quality ensuring my tech test followed good OOP, was developed through TDD and was DRY.
- My developer process was improved with all the reviews I had and I now feel confident coding infront of anyone
