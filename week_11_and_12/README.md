# Weeks 11 & 12

## Goal:

1. Use high-quality processes to build an extended project in a team

This was the final engineering project at Makers where my team decided to make a social platform where tutors and students and connect with one another. The app is called Tutoroom. It consists of a React JS front end coupled with a Ruby on Rails API backend.

## Work done / evidence

#### Plan a project and break down into tickets
- Worked as part of a team to create a high-quality front-end application Tutoroom [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/tutoroom_fe)
- Used Trello to keep track of workload and manage workflow
- Created build order of features to ensure development was logical and iterative 
- Developed wireframes to visualise the website ahead of building it
- Worked in an agile way with sprints, stand ups and retros

#### Deliver a high-quality web application
- I led the development of the front-end and acted as the tech lead for the project
- I worked closely with the back-end team to ensure the full stack was developed harmoniously 
- I wrote the majority of code for the React front end

#### Rapidly learn a new technology
- Learned how to use React JS and the JSX syntax including props, components, hooks and state.
- I also learned how to use React testing library to test drive React code.
- Deployed bootstrap for rapid styling of the app in addition to custom CSS

## Reflections

This project was both very challenging and rewarding. 
- I spent a significant amount of personal time learning how to use React for the first time as well as React testing library
- I wrote the majority of code for the front end and supported other developers on the front end team
- I worked with the backend team on full stack troubleshooting to ensure full app functionality
- Whilst the project was challenging and demanding, it was highly rewarding seeing the whole thing come together at the end
