# Weeks 8 & 9

## Goal:

1. Working in a team, deliver a high quality web-app

## Work done / evidence

#### Plan a project and break down into tickets
- Worked as part of a team to build a clone of Facebook using Ruby on Rails [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/acebook-StringMeAlong)
- Used Trello to keep track of workload and manage workflow
- Developed wireframes to visualise the website ahead of building it
- Worked in an agile way with sprints, stand ups and retros

#### Work as a team to deliver a working app
- Collaborated with others to research, develop, build and test features
- Assisted team members who were having difficulties
- Manage Git workflow with different pairs working on different features

#### Rapidly learn a new technology
- Learned how to use Ruby on Rails to rapidly develop a web app
- Also learned how to use Bootstrap to style HTML views

## Reflections

This project was both very challenging and rewarding. 
- Getting familiar with Rails in just a few days was not easy but using gems made building out functionality easier
- Having done a lot of backend work in previous projects I focussed more on the frontend in this task
- I used a lot of personal time to research Bootstrap and built a mock website to practice using it
- As a result I'm much more confident in styling websites which was a weakness of mine
- I was very pleased with the final result as the web app looks very professional
