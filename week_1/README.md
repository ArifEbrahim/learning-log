# Week 1

## Goals:

1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
2. Pair using the driver-navigator style
3. Follow an effective debugging process
4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

## Work done / evidence 

#### Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
- Attended TDD workshop
- Completed workshop exercise (Library) [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/learning-log/tree/main/week_1/code/library)
- Completed practice exercise (Remembering names) [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/learning-log/tree/main/week_1/code/remembering_names)
- Completed practice exercise (Birthdays) [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/birthdays)
- Read notes on testing behaviour vs state
- Made own notes on writing effective tests
- Significant practice during the weekly coding challenge (Boris Bikes) [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/boris_bikes4)
- Further practice during the individual weekend coding challenge (Airports) [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/airport_challenge)

#### Pair using the driver-navigator style
- Reviewed information on effective collaboration with Github
- Reviewed a guide on effective pair-programming techniques
- Paired with a new partner Tue - Fri and worked on the weekly coding challenge 
- Got postive feedback from all 4 pair partners 

#### Follow an effective debugging process
- Attended debugging workshop
- Completed workshop exercise 1 (Fizzbuzz) [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/learning-log/tree/main/week_1/code/debugging_fizzbuzz)
- Completed workshop exercise 2 (Cipher) [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/learning-log/tree/main/week_1/code/debugging_fizzbuzz/exercise_2)
- Completed practice exercise (Geocoder) [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/learning-log/tree/main/week_1/code/geocoder)
- Read notes on debugging approaches 
- Made own notes on effective debugging process 

#### Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP
- Read up on OOP 
- Made own notes on encapsulation 

## Reflections

1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods (score: 4/5)
  - I got a lot of practice using this skill during the week
  - Built a lot of knowledge on writing good tests (Arrange, Act, Assert) and using RSpec
  - Good grounding in TDD principles (red / green / refactor, user stories & domain models, feature tests / unit tests)

2. Pair using the driver-navigator style (score: 3/5)
 - Researched good pair programming etiquette and different styles (driver-navigator, ping pong, strong style)
 - Gained good experience with 4 different pair partners this week, feedback [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/learning-log/blob/main/week_1/week%201%20feedback.png)
 - Looking forward to getting more practice 

3. Follow an effective debugging process (score: 4/5)
  - I got a lot of practice using this skill during the week
  - Good grounding in debugging process (tighten the loop, get visibility)

4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP (score: 2/5)
  - Did not have much time to cover this objective
