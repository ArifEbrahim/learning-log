# Week 7

## Goals:

1. Build a frontend single-page app using only pure Javascript.
2. Request and use data from an external API.
3. Explain that libraries are made of ordinary code that I could write myself if I needed to.

## Work done / evidence

#### Build a frontend single-page app using only pure Javascript.
- Worked as part of a team to build a notes app in JS/HTML/CSS [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/notes_app)
- Used Trello board to break down tasks and assign tickets to team members
- Used local storage & hashchange to create a single page front end app

#### Request and use data from an external API.
- Leveraged fetch to interact with Makers API to convert text to Emojis

#### Explain that libraries are made of ordinary code that I could write myself if I needed to.
- Built a simple testing framework from scratch based on Jasmine
- Created simple matchers and callbacks with output in the console


## Reflections

This week was a good experience and provided an opportunity to further develop my JS skills:
- built a single page app using local storage and hashchange
- focussed on object oriented design such as SRP, encapsulation and delegation by having classes & a skinny model
- further practiced using a API and getting used to the async nature of JS
- got more practice in HTML & CSS by styling the app
